# Data Analysis Dashboard - TechTalent Bootcamp

This repository contains the code and resources for the Data Analysis Dashboard developed as a group project at the end of the TechTalent Data Science Bootcamp. The dashboard is built using Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Plotly, and Dash. It showcases the skills learned during the intensive 6-week full-time course while providing a user-friendly interface to explore and interact with freely available climate change datasets through visualizations and insights.

## Description

As part of the final project for the TechTalent Data Science Bootcamp, our group developed this Data Analysis Dashboard to demonstrate our proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using industry-standard tools and techniques. The dashboard allows users to gain a deeper understanding of climate patterns and trends by exploring various climate change datasets interactively.

## Features

The Data Analysis Dashboard offers the following key features:
- Interactive Visualizations: Utilizing Plotly and Dash, the dashboard presents dynamic and interactive visualizations, enabling users to customize the charts and plots based on their preferences.
- Data Manipulation: We use Python and Pandas to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation to ensure the climate data is in an optimal format for analysis.
- Dataset Selection: We use freely available climate change datasets obtained from Kaggle and World of Data.
- Comparative Analysis: The dashboard allows users to compare different climate variables, apply filters, and examine patterns in the data.
- Export and Sharing: Users can export the generated visualizations in various formats or share them with others effortlessly.
